resigned,My gf and I had a long talk tonight - it was about how bad my depression has been for a few weeks. I told her it's been really bad and I'll probably never entirely recover from depressive symptoms permanently because the evidence shows it's unlikely. She suddenly went off about how if I love her I can't ever think like this (even though I already was) - is that manipulation?

insignificant,I lost my dad to suicide several years ago and it still affects my life in a major way. I wasn't too hard on myself about it because I did the grief counseling and I'm currently in therapy.. however my mom thinks I need to let it go and makes me feel that I'm not okay for the feelings I still have about the loss. I'm wondering if anyone has experience similar to tragedy still holding you back?

bewildered,I'm feeling really weird about something and need help. My boyfriend is very insecure about us and thinks I cheat on him. I have never cheated on anyone.

Every time I try to talk to him he gets mad. I don't want to think he's cheating.....I would break.

Now all I do is smoke but the catch is; I'm really happy and content with life right now but Am I lying to myself? Am I actually just using weed to cover up my sadness? Does happiness count if I'm still smoking? What do you guys think?
stable,Ever since I was 13 I've experimented with smoking weed and drinking alcohol. I'm 18 now. I've had a few really bad incidents and was sober for almost 6 months and then it got bad again with drinking. Now all I do is smoke but the catch is; I'm really happy and content with life right now but Am I lying to myself? Am I actually just using weed to cover up my sadness? Does happiness count if I'm still smoking? What do you guys think?
ashamed,"I lost quite a bit of weight this past 6 months, but moved to a new city and feel that I'm gaining it all back. I feel worthless, lazy, less energetic, and just sad that I worked so hard for my clothes to feel tight and looking in the mirror seeing what I used to be. I'm having trouble controlling my eating, especially at night. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to control this? I feel like I'm at the end of my rope."
